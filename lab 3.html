			<p style="font-size: 19px;"> It wasn't all too long ago that the only health your doctor would've considered seriously was that of your body. So, if you came in with a complaint of a broken bone or a bruised leg, then they would be able to help you. But if you came in complaining of a broken heart or a bruised ego, they may have stared at you blankly. </p>

			<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopathy"> <img src="./images/111.JPG" style="width:200px;height: 200px;"> </a>
			<p style="font-size: 19px"> Psychopathy is a condition characterized by the absence of empathy and the blunting of other affective states. Callousness, detachment, and a lack of empathy enable psychopaths to be highly manipulative. Nevertheless, psychopathy is among the most difficult disorders to spot. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px"> Psychopathic behavior varies greatly from one individual to another. Some are sex offenders and murderers. But others may be successful leaders. It all depends on their traits. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px;"> The study found that higher initial psychopathy was associated with steeper increases in general inhibitory control and the inhibition of aggression over time. That effect was magnified among "successful" offenders, or those who reoffended less. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px"> Scientists who scanned the brains of men convicted of murder, rape and violent assaults have found the strongest evidence yet that psychopaths have structural abnormalities in their brains. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px"> It‚Äôs an idea that you might already have had: your boss is a psychopath. Well, new research shows that this could be the case, even if he did a personality test when he or she came to take the job. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that people with psychopathic tendencies who have high IQs can mask their symptoms by manipulating tests designed to reveal their personalities.  </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px"> A good rule of thumb for many Westerners is this: wear black to a funeral. Black, in this context, signifies solemnity; it‚Äôs how we show that we‚Äôre grieving and respecting that of those around us. Weddings, on the other hand, are known for white ‚Äì but only for the bride! While the bride wears white to symbolize purity and uphold tradition, wearing white as a guest is often seen as an attempt at pulling attention away from the ceremony, which can be considered gravely insulting depending on one‚Äôs company. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px"> The study showed that psychopaths have reduced connections between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the part of the brain responsible for sentiments such as empathy and guilt, and the amygdala, which mediates fear and anxiety. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 19px"> Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism toward someone or something you feel has deliberately done you wrong. 
            Anger can be a good thing. It can give you a way to express negative feelings, for example, or motivate you to find solutions to problems.
            But excessive anger can cause problems. </p>
